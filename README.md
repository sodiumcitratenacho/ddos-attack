# ddos-attack
this is a very simple ddos attack that i found online coded in python
DISCLAIMER! THIS IS ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPORSES AND I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES.
i will show you how to use it.

1. Open python and windows command prompt.
2. run the program and and it will ask you for its source ip address, the target address, and a source port number
3. to find your source port number, open windows command prompt and type in nestat -a followed by the source ip address
4. it i'll show a long line of numbers with a word in front of it. if it says established, thats the number you should use.
 thanks for reading!
